# Custom Asset Pack Settings

A custom asset pack can include more than one Addressable group. Using Custom Asset Pack Settings inspector, you can create, rename, change the Delivery Type, and delete the custom asset packs.

If you delete a custom asset pack while it is being used in Play Asset Delivery schema for some Addressable groups,
* **Include In Custom Asset Pack** option in those groups automatically turns off.
* The groups inherit the **Delivery Type** of the deleted custom asset pack. This means the groups now have the same **Delivery Type** as that of the deleted custom asset pack.
