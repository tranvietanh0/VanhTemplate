# Addressables for Android package

The Addressables for Android package works in conjunction with the Addressables package to support Play Asset Delivery and provides you tools to pack Addressable groups into Android asset packs. This way you can take full advantage of asset pack based dynamic delivery.

Furthermore, you can pack different texture compression variants to Android asset packs with Texture Compression Targeting support for your project.
